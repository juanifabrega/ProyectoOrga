Wake up in the mornin'
And I pull the covers over my head
Hey-oh (Week is starting, week is starting)
I gotta get it movin'
But I'd rather stay here instead
Hey, hey (School is calling, school is calling)

My hair's a disaster, don't know what to do
But I need to move faster to make it through
This crazy morning has got me confused
(Clock is racing, time is wasting
Mind's in circles, brain is spacing)

Everywhere that I go
Everything that I do
I can't shake these Monday blues
'Cause some days, I can't find the way
Out of this haze, hope I'll be okay

Just can't seem to get it right
A cloud is hanging over me
Hey (Rain is falling, rain is falling)
I wish it was the weekend
'Cause you know that's where I'd rather be
Hey, hey (Friday's calling, Friday's calling)

I wonder what things won't go my way
Or if I'll ever make it through the day
I hope this feeling won't lead me astray
(You'll get through it, you can do it
With your gals, there's nothing to it)

Everywhere that I go
Everything that I do
I can't shake these Monday blues
'Cause some days, I can't find the way
Out of this haze, hope I'll be okay

Just when I feel like it might come crashing down
I can count on my friends to help me turn my mood around!

(With my gals, there's nothing to it!)
Everywhere that I go
With everything that I do
I'll say goodbye to the Monday blues
'Cause I've got my friends with me
And the sunshine is all I see

Everywhere that I go
With everything that I do
The world feels so fresh and new
'Cause I've got my friends with me
And those blues are ancient history!
